# Hello, World!
#### My name is Alex.

I first got into programming when I was 10, with a lego robotics kit named "Mindstorms". My passion for programming in the labView GUI language brought me a lot of skills before I even knew the names of high level programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C, Java etc.). This brought me interests in building computers. I even founded the "Computer Building Club" in Senior year of high school and led it for two years. 

Beyond my experience at 13 years old with labView and computer hardware, I have delved into learning programming for mobile applications, advanced websites, and fun security projects. I was fascinated with iOS Security research (Jailbreaking), working with decompiled application code (IDA Pro + Decrypted IPA Applications ex. Minecraft Pocket Edition modding for iOS), virtual machines with both type 1 or type 2 hypervisors (ProxMox, QEMU + Linux KVM with macOS 15, and baremetal Hackintoshes  ►(Check out my favorite builds below!) 


## I’m currently going to school ...

I am a student at University of Montana. I am Majoring in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science Engineering. Currently a Freshman, learning Python!
Really enjoying coding right now!

~~I am a student at Prominio Tech. I am learning more about Front-End technologies such as JavaScript, React, jQuery, Bootstrap, and more. I strive to become a knowlegeable Front-End Stack Engeneer.~~ 

****UPDATE:*** I obtained my Front-End Certificate of Completion from Promineo Tech!
