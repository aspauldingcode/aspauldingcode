# Hey! My name is Alex.

I first got into programming when I was 10, with a lego robotics kit named "Mindstorms". My passion for programming in the labView GUI language brought me a lot of skills before I even knew the names of today's main programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C, Java etc.).

As I grew up, I learned many technologies throughout my content-creation passions. I learned how to make videos for youtube, which brought me interests in building computers with the latest and greatest hardware. This has given me the oppertunities I have today, understanding computer hardware and software. I even founded the "Computer Building Club" in Senior year of high school and led it for two years. 

Beyond my experience with labView and computer hardware, Ihave delved into learning programming for mobile applications, advanced websites, and video games (using Unreal Engine and Unity Engine).

## Iâ€™m currently going to school ...

I am a student at Prominio Tech. I am learning more about Front-End technologies such as JavaScript, React, jQuery, Bootstrap, and more. I strive to become a knowlegeable Front-End Stack Engeneer.
